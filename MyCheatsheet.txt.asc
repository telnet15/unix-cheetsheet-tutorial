GNU/LINUX RAMB MANUAL,TWEAKS AND TRICKS

INTRODUCTION:
	Many people is misconcepted or misinformed about LINUX. Linux is not an O.S. but it is a kernel. It is useless when it is used alone it needs distros to make it a powerful operating system.There are are many Linux-Distros--Debian, Slackware, OpenSuse, Fedora, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Red Hat, CentOS, Kali  and the list goes on and on everyday.Many of us have no clue that Android O.S. use LINUX kernel or else it will be just a cripple. Many of us don’t recognize how powerful a linux distro is. Most of us are not aware that 85 to 97 percent of websites in the wold run in Linux Distros.

WHY I WROTE THIS?:
	I wrote this for a personal reason. Linux is good when it comes to security but is hard to use ---> It will be only hard If you don’t know what to do. Just invest some brain cells and it will be useful.Hoping would be a beginning for those who just learning the ropes.I intend it to be cheatsheet for newbie.Empirical Experience there are many times I have been in a forum, not all the posts there are useful. I chose the best of 
them. So I have a reference when it comes tweaking.My last reason. I don’t want to forget it.



I. MAY COMMAND LIVE AND PERSIST
	Don’t get intimidated by black screen and flickering green text on screen like those we’ve seen on those Hacker movies and claim to be a 
super genious. Those overated and bullshits.

	CLI --> Command Line Interface. CLI is useful use lesser memmory unlike its opponent GUI (Graphical Use’s Interface) use much memmory

BASH or Bourne Again SHell:A Linux/Unix shell that you type your command there are alternatives like xterm and konsole. The counterpart of bash in Windows is Batch files like Batch file, BASH does not need to be compiled to run. it just runs, and could change the code on the fly.

One of the useful tool Xterm shell is the crontab. I used to delete those files over and over again with this tool you can elimate
those habitual deletion of file and saves a lot times. In Linux shell type “crontab -l”
in my case : this is my crojobs it includes of the file path of my  bash script---xhistory.sh
To edit the crontab type the “crontab -e" on linux shell

johndoe@linuxdistros:~$ crontab -e                  
Put the following  lines of command and save it then restart your machine. It supposed to
work.

#every  15 minutes the machine will execute this bash script file
*/15 * * * *  sh "/home/john/cronjobs/xhistory.sh"

And the xhistory.sh contains the following lines of script commands.


#It fills .bash_history with ramdom characters for 34 times
shred -n 34 "/home/charm/.bash_history"
#Then emptying the file by filling with null bytes

cat /dev/null > /home/john/.bash_history
history -c
history -w

shred -n 34 "/home/john/.local/share/recently-used.xbel"
cat /dev/null > /home/john/.local/share/recently-used.xbel

shred -n 34 "/home/john/.config/smplayer/smplayer.ini"
cat /dev/null > "/home/john/.config/smplayer/smplayer.ini"

The exections secure delete the contents of history files. It is a little bit
counter hacking but it is good when you used it mysql shell, rlogin, ssh passwords
it prevents the attacker to exploit you passwords. And one more thing it saves disk space.
Minute   Hour    Day   MONTH   YEAR      commands
 *        *       *     *        *       /root/run_me.sh

HARDENED NETWORK SECURITY

iptables --> it is a very versatile firewall native in linux kernel. You don’t need to install a a 3rd party software, you just need 
			know how it works

YOUR SECURITY IS VITAL. You could avoid hackers scanning and launching ARP Network poisoning (Like wifikill on android devices )
which can cut you out from internet. And the worse is they can still information, passwords and even credit card number by
launching ssl strip tools. You could avoid that and become stealth in a network like in a public internet network.
Somebody can ping scan your machine your machine and that is start of the vulnerability. You are also vulnerale of what they call it
“Ping of death” which is a kind of DOS (Denial of Service) Attack and MITM (Man inn The Middle Attack) Attak which can totally strip naked
your privacy and it allows someone to steal your passwords in the site your visited. You could avoid those threat by utilizing
the following commands in linux system shell. 

NOTE: It requires root access 

#DISALLOWING REMOTE ACCESS in x11
root@linuxshell:~$iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 6000  -j REJECT
root@linuxshell:~$iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --destination-port 6000  -j REJECT
root@linuxshell:~$ip6tables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 6000 -j REJECT
root@linuxshell:~$ip6tables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --destination-port 6000 -j REJECT

#Disallowing ping from someone. Your machine rejects ping it does not reply. 
root@linuxshell:~$iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j REJECT
root@linuxshell:~$iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -j REJECT
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.103 -J DROP --> Drop all packets from specific IPaDD

To Check it out if the code works

root@linuxshell:$ iptables --list
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
REJECT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:x11 reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
REJECT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere             icmp echo-request reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
REJECT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:x11 reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
REJECT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere             icmp echo-reply reject-with icmp-port-unreachable




This one will prevent your machine from WifiKill and MITM and DOS attack in Local Network.
NOTE: It requires root access.
This one is wlan or wifi

root@linuxshell:~$echo "1"  > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/wlan0/arp_ignore
root@linuxshell:~$echo "8" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/wlan0/arp_announce

This one is for LAN or Ethernet card:
root@linuxshell:~$echo "1"  > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/wlan0/arp_ignore
root@linuxshell:~$echo "8" > /proc/sys/
net/ipv4/conf/wlan0/arp_announce


#######################################
YOU SHOULD TRY sysctl -a
You can set some firewall rules
and it retains even the system is  restarted
the path of config file is

HARDENED PRIVACY ( needs to be edited)

In this section I will tackle more advance security. If you are an average internet users you don’t need to do this stuff, but if you are a journalist, eloectronic privacy
advocate or a  wistleblower you want to expose some corruptions and it is definitely  a matter of life and death. You have to be careful I advice to turnoff your swap before encrypting files and send it to someone.

I highly recommend to use “Tails” linux distro. A bootable OS can be booted on usb  and CD. But if you want to leave any digital fingerprint and you want to  hide an 
incriminating data.  (just google it)

After your machine boot up. Do this first in Linux Shell.

swapoff -a

a -  all. turn of swap totaly
you can check it out by: typing the following command on Bash
	htop  -  swap memmory should appear 0.
          freem -a

The swap memmory also can be encrypted. just google it.




Creation of 6MB file
dd if=/dev/urandom of=swapfile.crypt bs=1M count=64
loop=$(losetup -f)
losetup ${loop} swapfile.crypt
cryptsetup open --type plain --key-file /dev/urandom ${loop} swapfile
mkswap /dev/mapper/swapfile
swapon /dev/mapper/swapfile

The result:

# swapon -s
Filename                                Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/mapper/swap0                       partition       4000176 0       -1
/dev/mapper/swap1                       partition       2000084 0       -2
/dev/mapper/swapfile                    partition       65528   0       -3

swap0 and swap1 are real partitions.

This Configuration uses randomly generated keys at boot and will not support Hibernation to hard disk! You Should Disable Hibernation through your respectie DE Power Management Utility and set it to Shutdown on Critical to avoid Data Loss!

Make sure to run sudo -s or su before running the following.

    Disable Swap:

    # swapoff -a

    Locate the existing Swap Partition

    # lsblk

    You will get something like this:

    sda3    8:3    0     8G  0 part [SWAP]

    Overwrite Old Swap

    # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024000 of=/dev/sda<#>

    for example:

    # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024000 of=/dev/sda3

    fstab setup

    # vim /etc/fstab

    Replace old SWAP device with crypttab mapper name: /dev/mapper/cswap

    #<file system>      <mount point>   <type>  <options>   <dump>  <pass>
    /dev/mapper/cswap   none            swap    pri=1,defaults  0   0

    Crypto Setup

    # ls -lF /dev/disk/by-id

    For Example:

    ata-HGST_HTS545050A7E680_TEK55D4F0BU3GV-part3 -> ../../sda3

    # vim /etc/crypttab

    # <name>    <device>                            <password>  <options>
      cswap     /dev/disk/by-id/ata-HGST_HTS545050A7E680_TEK55D4F0BU3GV-part3   /dev/urandom    swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256,size=256

    Active Encrypted Swap

    # reboot

    Verify Enctypted Swap Operations

    For example:

    # dmsetup -C info 
    cswap      253   0 L--w    2    1      0 CRYPT-PLAIN-cswap  
    # lsblk
    ├─sda3                8:3    0     8G  0 part  
    │ └─cswap             253:0    0     8G  0 crypt [SWAP]
    # cat /proc/swaps 
    Filename                Type        Size    Used    Priority
    /dev/dm-0               partition   8385532 0       -1


####################################################################
ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES

You can also edit environmental variables. In your home directory search for .bahrc
 if there’s none in existence make one. This is a cool thing you can decide what you wanted
 to do with your bash shell environment. Open “.bashrc" and add this line:
PS1='\u@\h:\w\$ '

When you open the cosole the display would be like this.

john@bashshell:~$

you can just change it whatever you want to do with it like:
PS1='\u@\h:\w\# '

It results:
 john@bashshell:~#______


There is another one useful for changing environmental  variables.
this one  is like a starup folder in windows.

open the file path  /etc/profile.d/

If you ought to install software in another  folder besides the nstandard installation folder (like your new downloaded firefox you want it to install in other folder like an encrypted disk beside the standard disk)you have to change the environmental variables like in this case the java is installed in none standard way. you can check it out by typing  “which java” in my case java could not found because it is installed in none standard way. 
First I move The jkd7 folder from /usr/lib64/jdk7 to  /usr/jdk7   (you can also do this in umounted devices encrypted volume like truecrypt and luks you program runs there)

if i type java -version  in bash I recieve this
bash: java: command not found

This the original path
#!/bin/sh
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib64/jdk7
export PATH='/usr/lib64/jvm/bin:/usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin:/usr/lib64/jvm/bin:/usr/lib64/jvm/jre/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib64/kde4/libexec:/usr/lib64/qt/bin'

This is the modified path
#!/bin/sh
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/jdk7
export PATH='/usr/jdk7/bin:/usr/jdk7/jre/bin:/usr/jdk7/bin:/usr/jdk7/jre/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/jdk7/bin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib64/kde4/libexec:/usr/lib64/qt/bin'
 
restart your machine.
on conssole type: java -version
Java version "1.7.0_55"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)



You supposed to see the java vesion. In that case it should work all the way.

If you want to torrify your download. run tor first and do the
next step: this time i download the file with name “youtube-dl”
i tunnel the connection in TOR using socks5
 curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9150 http://youtube-dl.org/latest/youtube-dl -o youtube-dl

The good thing about “curl” if the download is interupted or  experinced disconnection you can still resume your download. if the file is too large and you want continue the download the next day you can still resume the remaining bytes.

OPENSSL OPEN SSL
There was something in my machine always bothering me I can’t install
openssl properly it was always butt-in the older installed ssl version
the problem is I was so stupid that I din’t think about the path name of the old one just to overight my machine is a little bit eccentric it din’t install openssl in the standard directory so i have no configure the installation first this is the path that work in my machine: ./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl
./config
make
make test
make install

 I just browsed it on the web I don't know if it is working﻿

Well, that didn’t work like intended. We dropped ARP related traffic to the IP address, but not on IP level. This is also visible in the arp -n list:
root@ubuntu:/data# arp -n
 Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
 192.168.1.20             ether   00:a7:22:23:d1:f3   C                     eth0
 192.168.1.1              ether   d8:d7:21:22:5a:f4   C                     eth0
So to make this work, we simply have to flush the ARP cache. We delete the related ARP entry:
root@ubuntu:/data# arp -d 192.168.1.1
root@ubuntu:/data# arp -n
 Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
 192.168.1.20             ether   00:a7:22:23:d1:f3   C                     eth0
 192.168.1.1                      (incomplete)                              eth0







﻿
Specific traffic filtering
Back to our original mission: only allow our router to exchange ARP packets.
root@ubuntu:/data# Block ARP traffic from all machines (default: DENY)
arptables -P INPUT DROP

root@ubuntu:/data# Allow router (fixed ARP)
arptables -A INPUT --source-mac d8:d7:21:22:5a:f4 -j ACCEPT
All ARP packets are blocked now. Each system which will transmitting traffic will end up as an (incomplete) entry.
Enable all ARP traffic
If we want to allow traffic again:
root@ubuntu:/data# arptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
root@ubuntu:/data# arptables --flush
Flushing the full ARP cache can be done with ip utility:
root@ubuntu:/data# ip -s neighbour flush all
Conclusion
Arptables is a very powerful utility to filter traffic and avoid an unexpected router taking over our connectivity. However, keep in mind that connectivity is not fully blocked. Only ARP traffic is blocked (layer 2/3 on the OSI model). If someone is able to manually add an entry to the ARP table, traffic is able to flow again.




One hardening trick I like is to turn off ARP completely with:
ip link set dev eth0 arp off
Then add a static ARP entry for the router so you can get to that:
arp -s 10.0.0.2 00:0c:29:c0:94:bf

In this moment in time I completely configured working dnsmasq DNS server in
this machine but sandly my linux machine at home is broken. It saddens me the fact that I have good internet connection at home and cound not even practice stardard networking practice at home I had to be a snitch. To digest everything I learned in a short period at time. I know it is wrong but I coudn’t help myself to solve something (a long time problem) . I eager to learn more that’s how I get my drive to insist my persitence in learning.
By the way I wanted to write down details how I solved that DNS (dnsmasq problem)

I have installed new linux base OS
It is in its infancy but I guess I would learn a lotfrom it
The first and foremost problem I encountered and solved is about
the autologin of Debian OS even though it has password(It is modified version of Debian it is sort of minimalist OS so many features are not includedin the system. like the desktop manager ). I just googled it unlike
before I had to do it all by myself.

systemctl set-default multi-user.target

To make it back in autologin

systemctl set-default graphical.target

As I  have said, I don’t have Desktop manager I couldn’t
even adjust the brightness. Just like I did in the first I googled it
Debian has a lot of community support unlike the former distro I had.
This is the solution.

echo 1000 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
just like that. But it depends on your hardware you should follow the /sys/class/backlight and browse the directory to find out which is which.

I dont like Windows OS specially windows10 it is the biggest
spyware. It captures screen shots and the plain text of the text file
is being spied so I tranfered this text on a volume
I googled and it said you can make a virtual disk, like ext4 file system
you can make it, but you must make a file container first you can use

fallocate or dd (google it stupid). and make it by use some
tools like mkfs, e.g. mkfs.ext4 <nameofthefile) and you can mount it
like you just mounting a regular disk.

Creation of 500mb container:

dd if=/dev/zero of=MyDrive.img bs=1M count=500
This one is pretend to be a broken disk


dd if=/dev/zero bs=1k count=100 | tr "\000" "\377" > /dev/sdb
My discovery it can be used to wipe ssd/hhd
dd if=/dev/zero of=foo.bar bs=300k count=1 conv=notrunc
Formatting of the Container:

mkfs -t ext3 MyDrive.img
Now you can mount it.
mount MyDrive.img /mnt/mountfolder

NOTE TO MYSELF
Just searching all over again for something. Those pesky files stored in a removable SSD storage
I fear it is gone for good.
use  “dd” command to overwrite file with zeros or make a container file “mkfs” at least I have a clue
doing something than nothing.
I’ve got the best solution before.


Create your image file of the size you want:

dd if=/dev/zero of=./your.img bz=1M count=<number of megabytes you want>
Format it

mkfs.ext3 ./your.img
(Recheck that command before running it, do read what is printed out.)

Mount it:

mount -o loop ./your.img /some/mount/point
And you're done. Don't forget to unmount before you copy/send that image file anywhere.

dd if=/dev/zero of=~/theFile.img bs=1M count=10
$ /sbin/mkfs.ext4 theFile.img
$ sudo mount -o loop theFile.img /mnt/tmp/

I just discovered tcplay means tru3 crypt play it can create and mount TC volume
HERE ARE some of the procedures according to your need
Encrypting a file as a virtual volume
Invoke

 $ losetup -f
to find the first unused loopback device; in this example, /dev/loop0.

Note: As of udev 181-5, the loop device module is no longer auto-loaded.
Create a new container foo.tc, 20M in size for instance, in the working directory:

 # fallocate -l 20M foo.tc
 # losetup /dev/loop0 foo.tc
 # tcplay -c -d /dev/loop0 -a whirlpool -b AES-256-XTS
Enter a secure password for the volume, and confirm the query to overwrite foo.tc with the new volume. tcplay will then write random data into the volume. Map the volume and create a filesystem on it in order to mount

 # tcplay -m foo.tc -d /dev/loop0
 # mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/foo.tc
 # mount /dev/mapper/foo.tc /mnt/truecrypt/
To unset the container,

 # umount /mnt/truecrypt
 # dmsetup remove foo.tc
 # losetup -d /dev/loop0
Mounting an existing container for a user
Consider /dev/loop0 the first unused loop device, foo.tc the TrueCrypt container, /home/you/truecrypt/ the desired mount point. The user you in this example has uid=1000 and gid=100. The steps for mounting the container as a virtual volume are:

Associate loop device with the container
Map the container to the loop device
Mount the container in the filesystem
The following commands perform the above actions.

 # losetup /dev/loop0 foo.tc
 # tcplay -m foo.tc -d /dev/loop0
 # mount -o nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=100 /dev/mapper/foo.tc /home/you/truecrypt/
Note, if the container uses ext4 or another filesystem that supports file ownership, the uid and gid parameters aren't needed and will not work. Therefore the third command would be simply:

 # mount -o nodev,nosuid /dev/mapper/foo.tc /home/you/truecrypt/
To reverse them:

 # umount /home/you/truecrypt/
 # dmsetup remove foo.tc
 # losetup -d /dev/loop0
Using tcplay-helper
The tcplay-helper-gitAUR[broken link: package not found] tool simplifies the process of creating, mounting and unmounting tc-play containers. The tool is still a work-in-progress, but should work fine for most users wanting to work with simple secure tc-play containers.

The following command creates a 3Mb container called foo.tc.

 # tcplay-helper create foo.tc 3M
To mount the container file we can either mount it as root with the following command. The container will be mounted under /mnt/truecrypt/

 # tcplay-helper open foo.tc
Alternatively, we can supply a username to mount the container as.

 # tcplay-helper open foo.tc archie
Finally, to close the container this command does the trick.

 # tcplay-helper close foo.tc
